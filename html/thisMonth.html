          With its emphasis on breathing practices and medita­tion—both of which
          help calm and center the mind— it’s hardly surprising that yoga also
          brings mental benefits, such as reduced anxiety and depression. What
          may be more surprising is that it actually makes your brain work
          better.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paragraph-space">A sharper brain</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          When you lift weights, your muscles get stronger and bigger. When you
          do yoga, your brain cells develop new connections, and changes occur
          in brain struc­ture as well as function, resulting in improved
          cog­nitive skills, such as learning and memory. Yoga strengthens parts
          of the brain that play a key role in memory, attention, awareness,
          thought, and language. Think of it as weightlifting for the brain.
          Studies using MRI scans and other brain imaging technology have shown
          that people who regularly did yoga had a thicker cerebral cortex (the
          area of the brain responsible for information processing) and
          hippocampus (the area of the brain involved in learn­ing and memory)
          compared with nonpractitioners. These areas of the brain typically
          shrink as you age, but the older yoga practitioners showed less
          shrinkage than those who did no yoga. This suggests that yoga may
          counteract age-related declines in memory and other cognitive skills.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-space">
          Research also shows that yoga and meditation may improve executive
          functions, such as reasoning, decision making, memory, learning,
          reac­tion time, and accuracy on tests of mental acuity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paragraph-space">Improved mood</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          All exercise can boost your mood by lowering levels of stress
          hormones, increasing the production of feel-good chemicals known as
          endorphins, and bringing more oxygenated blood to your brain. But yoga
          may have additional ben­efits. It can affect mood by elevating levels
          of a brain chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is
          associated with better mood and decreased anxiety.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          Meditation also reduces activity in the limbic system—the part of the
          brain dedicated to emotions. As your emotional reac­tivity diminishes,
          you have a more tempered response when faced with stressful
          situations.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          Drugs and talk therapy have traditionally been the go-to remedies for
          depression and anxiety. But complementary approaches, such as yoga,
          also helps, and yoga stacks up well when compared with other
          complementary therapies.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          A review of 15 studies, published in the jour­nal Aging and Mental
          Health, looked at the effect of a variety of relaxation techniques on
          depression and anxiety in older adults. In addition to yoga,
          interven­tions included massage therapy, progressive muscle
          relaxation, stress management, and listening to music. While all the
          techniques provided some benefit, yoga and music were the most
          effective for both depression and anxiety. And yoga appeared to
          provide the lon­gest-lasting effect.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-space">
          A number of small studies have found that yoga can help with
          post-traumatic stress dis­order (PTSD). It is not used by itself, but
          as an add-on treatment to help reduce intrusive memories and
          emo­tional arousal and to produce calmer, steadier breathing. Deep,
          slow breathing is associated with calmer states because it helps
          activate the parasympathetic nervous system.
